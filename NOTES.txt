The Penn Haptic Texture Toolkit was adapted for use with the MLHD by Randy Lee 
(ral63@pitt.edu) for Butterfly Haptics (Pittsburgh, PA). Compiled and built on Ubuntu 8.10

INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE AND BUILD:

1. Download code from https://github.com/ralee9/PennHaTT_MLHD

   or clone from https://github.com/ralee9/PennHaTT_MLHD.git
   
   Unzip and place all source code in a separate folder (i.e. /hatt_mlhd/), to 
   enable out of source builds. 

   
2. From the app root directory (i.e. /home/haptics/apps/haptic_texture_toolkit/)
   make an empty "build" directory, using the terminal:

        >> mkdir build

   or erase the current build directory (/haptic_texture_toolkit/build/). 
   
   The app root directory will now have the following structure:
   
        - haptic_texture_toolkit/
           - build/
           - hatt_mlhd/
              - CMakeLists.txt
              - src/
              - include/
              - gl/
              - ml/
              ... etc

              
3. Run cmake from the build directory. Assuming we are in /haptic_texture_toolkit/:
	
        >> cd build
        >> cmake ../hatt_mlhd

   CMake 2.6.0 is the minimum required version of CMake. CMake will search the system for
   OpenGL and GLUT libraries. Boost (http://www.boost.org/) is also required.

   
4. Run the make file created by CMake (while still in /haptic_texture_toolkit/build/)
   by entering

        >> make

   If CMake has been executed previously, "make" may be used to recompile and build the
   executable if small changes have been made to the source code. Running 
   "cmake ../hatt_mlhd" again is not necessary.

   
5. The executable will be found in /haptic_texture_toolkit/build/build/. To run
   from the terminal
        
        >> cd build
        >> ./HaTT_MLHD


6. To create a desktop launcher for this application, the correct working PATH 
must be specified, otherwise the texture images will not appear. The correct PATH is 
/haptic_texture_toolkit/build/build/, the location of the executable. While the path
to the icon may be slightly different, below is an example of a functioning
Ubuntu <Haptic Texture Toolkit.desktop> file:

The following is the original README included with the Penn Haptic Texture Toolkit:
********************************************************************************
This code has been tested to run on a Linux computer running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, with a GeForce GTX 570 graphics card and a SensAble Phantom Omni. 

When running the code, you can use the following keys to change the texture and behavior of the system:

Key Command List 
-----------------------------------------
+ --> Scroll Forward Through Textures
- --> Scroll Backward Through Textures
F/f --> Toggle Friction ON/OFF
T/t --> Toggle Texture ON/OFF
M/m --> Display menu in Terminal

Jump to Texture Group
----------------------
0 --> Paper
1 --> Plastic
2 --> Fabric
3 --> Tile
4 --> Carpet
5 --> Foam
6 --> Metal
7 --> Stone
8 --> Carbon Fiber
9 --> Wood

In order to compile and run the code the following library is needed:
- Boost 
	http://www.boost.org/ or the Ubuntu repository

In addition, the Open Haptics 3.0 API has to be correctly configured and OpenGL must be working on the machine for the graphics to be rendered and work properly.

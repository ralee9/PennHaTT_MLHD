The Penn Haptic Texture Toolkit was adapted for use with the MLHD by Randy Lee 
(ral63@pitt.edu) for Butterfly Haptics (Pittsburgh, PA). Compiled and built on Ubuntu 8.10

INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE AND BUILD:

1. From the app root directory (i.e. /home/haptics/haptics/apps/haptic_texture_toolkit/)
   make an empty "build" directory, using the terminal:

	> mkdir build

   or erase the current build directory (/haptic_texture_toolkit/build/)

2. Run cmake from the build directory. Assuming we are in /haptic_texture_toolkit/:
	
	> cd build
	> cmake ../hatt_mlhd

   CMake 2.6.0 is the minimum required version of CMake. CMake will search the system for
   OpenGL and GLUT libraries.

3. Run the make file created by CMake (still in the build directory)

	> make

   If CMake has been executed previously, "make" may be used to recompile and build the
   executable if small changes have been made. Running "cmake ../hatt_mlhd" is not 
   necessary.

4. The executable will be found in /haptic_texture_toolkit/build/build/



**NOTE: when creating a desktop launcher for this application, the correct working PATH 
ust be specified, otherwise the texture images will not appear. The correct PATH is 
/haptic_texture_toolkit/build/build/, the location of the execuatble. Below is a functioning
< .desktop> file:
